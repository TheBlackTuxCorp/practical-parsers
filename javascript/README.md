# Practical Parser: Javascript

This repository contains a simple Javascript parser which you can utilize to read input files from standard input using the Node process.

A boilerplate Javascript file (`index.js`) has been provided for you to work with.  The boilerplate already includes the Javascript parser which will parse the events from an input file.

By default, the boilerplate code will read and parse the file specified in the `solve` npm script.

Eg: `node index.js test.txt` will read and parse the `test.txt` file in the current directory.

## Steps to Run Solution

1. Run `npm run solve` to run the solution
2. Update the `solve` npm script to provide different input text files

## Tests

Feel free to run unit tests on the event parser via `npm test` to see the expected output from the parser
